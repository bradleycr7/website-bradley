<h2>About Miku Nakano ðŸ’™</h2>
  <img src="miku-pretty.jpg" alt="Miku Nakano photo" class="center-img">
  <p>
    Miku Nakano is one of the five sisters from <em>The Quintessential Quintuplets</em> manga and anime, and sheâ€™s definitely the one 
    who stands out the most to me. Sheâ€™s quiet, introverted, and super into Japanese history, especially the Sengoku era. 
    Sheâ€™s always wearing her blue headphones and usually wearing her iconic blue sweater. 
    Underneath her shy personality, sheâ€™s actually really caring, sincere, and determined. I love how sheâ€™s not good at 
    everything (like cooking and physical activities), but she never gives up. She also likes 
    unique things like matcha soda, which is kinda cute. Miku was the first of the sisters to fall in love with the main character, and she does 
    it in such a real, emotional way. Thatâ€™s a big reason why sheâ€™s my favorite, she was so determined to win the main character, even though she lost sadly. Sheâ€™s not loud or flashy, but she has this soft, gentle charm that 
    makes her stand out so much to me. She's just really, and honestlyâ€¦ I canâ€™t help but root for her every time, which is why I was team Miku when hoping who the main character ended up with. So... what other reasons make me like her so much?
